# Event-Listener-Project

Hello. This is my little project where I will try to implement my knowledge about JS event listeners + make some nice design.

The idea here is in data-... attribute, which is some kind of class or id and it gave me opportunity to quickly connect event's target's keyCodes with event listener.

I don't know for sure if some music here is free, but anyway i am noname :)
